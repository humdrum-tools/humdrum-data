## Filename:      Makefile
## URL:           http://github.com/humdrum-tools/humdrum-data/tree/main/Makefile
## Syntax:        GNU Makefile
##
## Description:   Manage downloading of Humdrum files from various
##                GitHub repositories.
##
## Usage:
##     all:       Download complete list of Humdrum files.
##     clear:     Delete all downloaded Humdrum files. (Does not
##                   delete any local files.)
##     nc:        Generate a list of note counts for each download directory
##                   and give a total sum of notes and downloaded file.
##     cu:        Check if updates are needed.
##     readme:    Regenerate README.md file (for maintenance only and not
##                   particularly for general use).
##
## In addition the % target is used to download subsets of Humdrum
## files.  The allowed targets are based on the filenames in
## .lists/LIST-*.tsv.  Example list targets:
##
##      make              Download complete set of files.
##      make 1520s-short  The 1520s Project digital scores, ID only filenames

##      make tonerow      Tonerows used by Schoenberg, Berg and Webern
##
## You can create your own .lists/LIST-*.tsv file(s) and run with make.  For
## exaple, create a file called .lists/LIST-mylist.tsv based on other examples
## in that directory, and then you can compile the list with the command
## "make mylist"
